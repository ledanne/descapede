# descapede
A discord wrapper written in python

This is currently being developed and I recommend not using it until we/I finish a release build.

Currently no documentation except docstrings.

## Modules

diswrap.abc - Basic types(to be implemented or to supply the shared functions among implemented copies)
diswrap.http - HTTP Router
diswrap.guild - Guild types
diswrap.client - The bot client.

Feel free to look through the code(and/or) contribute. I'm completely open to anything, nothing deserves to be called shit. To contribute look at CONTRIBUTING.md

Thank you

Arkae
